/**
 * Unit 13 project 8 
 * 
 * @author Chee M. Lee
 * 
 * This is the driver class for testing the application.
 * Console also outputs what is happening behind the GUI.
 * 
 * Operation:
 * Press the sort button at the bottom of the application
 * to visually see the scrambled colored threads become 
 * sorted into the Dutch National flag. 
 * 
 * The colored threads are randomized at run time. 
 * The application can only be run once. The sort
 * button will be disabled upon clicking of sort button.
 * 
 * To end the run of the application just simply close 
 * the window.
 * 
 * Note:
 * I think I strayed a bit from the book's example. I modified 
 * the given sort algorithm to the needs of what I thought would be 
 * a possible solution.
