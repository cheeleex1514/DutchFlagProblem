[ Dutch Flag problem ]

What is the Dutch Flag Problem?

The Dutch national flag problem is a computer science programming problem proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colours: red, white and blue. Given balls of these three colours arranged randomly in a line (the actual number of balls does not matter), the task is to arrange them such that all balls of the same colour are together and their collective colour groups are in the correct order.

[ Notes ]

Here is a sample project of my solution to the problem. There are many solutions out there and here is my solution in graphical form. 

A random set of bars will be generated and its position will be randomized. When the sort button is interacted with the program will sort each of the colored bars until all colors have been sorted to form the Dutch flag.
